# Telebot: Speech to text translation dataset crowdsourcing platform using Telegram Bots

In this project we use python language to create servers that can communicate with Telegram Bots via Telegram API. 
The database used in this project is MongoDB. 
This was initially developed to gather Persian audio parallel to english text. However, with a few modifications, 
you can use it for other datasets and other language pairs. 

The core dataset used for this project is selected from [Must-C](https://ict.fbk.eu/must-c/) dataset.

Using this service we collected an end-to-end speech-to-text Farsi-English dataset. You can access this dataset
from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ppcm65mrzujniia/telebot-fa-en.zip?dl=0)
